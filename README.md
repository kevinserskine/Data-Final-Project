TheBookShelf is an online bookstore developed during the pandemic for contactless book borrowing. Our system allows users to create an account and sign out a maximum of three books!

#Vision Statement: #We want an online, free, and safe booking system that other users can use without any hesitance. In the situation of the pandemic we thrive to give to those in need. Textbooks are an important part of one's learning and if one may not be able to a physical library, then, we simply bring the library to them. TheBookShelf is an online online bookstore used for signing out and tracking information about borrowed and purchased books from the online bookstore TheBookShelf in Oshawa Ontario.
